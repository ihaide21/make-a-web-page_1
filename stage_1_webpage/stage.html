		<p> The web is a bunch of computers linked together that communicte with each other. When a user requests a web page through a browser (eg. Google Chrome, Safari), their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a server. 
		<br> 
		In response, the server finds the relevant HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the screen.

	</div>
	
	<div 
	class="parag-contents">
	<p> HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documetns form the majority of the contents on the web.
	It provides a basic structure to a webpage, just as walls provide framework for rooms and hallways.  
	<br> 
	It is written in the form of HTML elements  anc web browsers can read HTML files and compose them into visible web pages that are easy to navigate through

	</div>

	<div 
	class="parag-contents">
		<p> HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. Most HTML elements have a start tag and an end tags that indicate where the element begins and where it ends. Those with exception to this rule are called empty/void tags. These tags, such as, breaks tags, don't have closing tags since they don't have any content.

		Inline vs. Block elements 
	</div>

	<div 
	class=parag-contents>
		<p> 
	Block elements form an invisible box around the content inside of them and normally start and end with a new line. Examples of block elements include div tag, h tag, and p tag...

	<br> 
	Inline elements are displayed without line breaks. Examples include span and break tag.

	<div 
	class="parag-contents">
		<p> Div tag is an example of a 'block element'. Div tags are used mainly for two reasons: <br>
		1. To logically organize our code
		2. They group our items together so we can add styling to the whole block at once. This avoids <em> repetition - a key concept in CSS</em>.

	<div

		<p> The tree-like structure of HTML comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. In a web browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. Below is the picture of it...

	<div 
	class="parag-contents">
		<p>
	When writing code, programmers use special text editors (Sublime Text, Text Wrangler). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

		What is CSS
	</div>

	<div 
	class="parag-contents">
		<p> CSS stands for Cascading Sytle Sheet. It is a powerful tool that enables us to add style to HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class. 
		<br> <br>

		At first I struggled with grasping this concept of <em>class</em>. While working on this page, lets say I have 10 paragraphs and I want five paragraphs to be red color and five blue. At first, I had to change the color of each paragraph individually, thereby, repeating the process 10 times. As soon as I realized this repetition, the concept of <em>class</em> was easy to understand then.
